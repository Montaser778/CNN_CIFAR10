# 🖼️ CNN CIFAR-10

**Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset, including training, evaluation, and performance visualization.**

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository demonstrates how to build and train **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset** into 10 categories.  
The workflow covers:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- CNN model building using PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras
- Model training and validation
- Visualization of accuracy and loss curves
- Evaluation on the test dataset

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

  - Convolutional layers, Pooling layers
  - Activation functions (ReLU, Softmax)
  - Fully connected layers
- **Training Deep Learning Models:**
  - Optimizers (Adam, SGD)
  - Loss functions (Cross-Entropy Loss)
  - Epochs and batch training
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
